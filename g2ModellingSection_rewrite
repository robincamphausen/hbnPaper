We model the emitters as two-level systems with a characteristic decay parameter $\tau_{LT}$ that describes the lifetime of the excited state. As the defects were probed with a femtosecond pulse, we can consider the excitation time infinitesimally short compared to the decay and thus the photon emission flux of a single pulse can simply be expressed as \cite{fischer_dynamical_2016}:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lifetime}
        p_{em}(t) = A  e^{-t/\tau_{LT}},
    \end{equation}
where $t$ is the time after excitation, and $A$ is a normalisation factor. To fit to the experimentally obtained $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ data we use the definition of the second-order coherence function:
    \begin{equation}
        g^{(2)}(\tau) = \frac{\langle I(t) I(t+\tau)\rangle}{\langle I(t) \rangle ^2}
    \end{equation}

As the defects were probed with a femtosecond pulsed laser (laser period of 12.5ns), the temporal width of the $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ peaks in \cref{fig:g2_decay} (a) allows us to fit an emitter decay lifetime parameter. Emission statistics were modelled considering the defects as two-level systems, with the probability of photon emission after some time $t$ given by \cite{fischer_dynamical_2016}:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lifetime}
        p_{em}(t) = A  e^{t/\tau_{LT}},
    \end{equation}
where $\tau_{LT}$ is the decay lifetime parameter and $A$ is a normalisation factor. 
Over long integration times photon emission probability maps to relative PL intensity and thus \cref{eq:lifetime} under pulsed excitation was used to fit to the experimentally obtained $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ values in \cref{fig:g2_decay} (a). 
For the \SI{1}{\micro\meter} wavelength emission the best fit was obtained modelling the PL as a single photon emitter with lifetime $\tau_{LT} = \tau_{1.24eV} = \SI{5.6 \pm 0.5}{\nano\second}$. 
The large discrepancy between our model and the measurement at $\tau=0$ is attributed to a high background emission level. 
On the other hand, the best fit for the \SI{860}{\nano\meter} wavelength emission was obtained by modelling the PL as two single photon emitters jointly excited by the same probe pulse, which explains well the presence of the small central peak in \cref{fig:g2_decay} (a). 
The emitter lifetime was found to be $\tau_{LT} = \tau_{1.44eV} = \SI{4.6 \pm 0.6}{\nano\second}$. 
\Cref{fig:g2_decay} (b) shows a close-up fitting of \cref{eq:lifetime} to the PL temporal peak, where the experimental data points are the means of all the $\tau \neq \SI{0}{\nano\second}$ peaks from \cref{fig:g2_decay} (a). 
The lifetime parameter values of $\tau_{1.24eV} = \SI{5.6 \pm 0.5}{\nano\second}$,  and $\tau_{1.44eV} = \SI{4.6 \pm 0.6}{\nano\second}$ are consistent with past results from lattice defect emitters in hBN \cite{tran_robust_2016, grosso_tunable_2017}.
